This project has been moved to [SDK-AMI.Garage.Maemo.org](http://sdk-ami.garage.maemo.org), since that hosting site is specifically targeting Maemo.

Maemo is the open source development platform for the Nokia Internet Tablet devices, such as the 770 and N800.  Amazon's Electric Compute Cloud (EC2) is a service that provides scalable computing resources on a pay-per-use model with no minimum fees.  The EC2 image created by this script is intended for use by those without a spare computer, insufficient resources to run a virtual computer (VMWare or QEMU), or simply don't want to wait to download a large virtual computer image.
